drop spc file(s) in same folder as tool, run split700_batch.bat to extract all samples, then play back the BRRs using BRRplayer, so you can preview them without any hassle.

Edit the bat and remove "--force" if it ever outputs a set that has massive leaps between any functionally good samples (such as Dracula X).

Can also convert them to wav by just dropping the output BRRs over brr2wav.
